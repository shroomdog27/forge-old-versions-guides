# Forge Old Versions Self-Help Guide
## Prelude
Hello! This is the self-help guide for old Minecraft versions. Everyone in the forge discord, including staff and other users, cannot provide support for old versions. Forge operates on the current version, plus 1 LTS version receiving support. This guide is intended to teach you how to help yourself with versions other than the supported ones. The purpose of this guide is to go over common issues with old versions, as well on how to read the `debug.log` and `crash-reports`. 

**DO NOT POST ANY LOGS TO #tech-support IN THE FORGE DISCORD. YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY HELP, IN ACCORDANCE WITH #rules 11. THIS GUIDE IS THE ONLY HELP YOU WILL RECEIVE.**

With that out of the way, let's get started!

This guide is divided into three sections. 

[Section 1](INSTALLERS.md) goes over common issues with the Forge Installers.

[Section 2](ISSUES.md) goes over common issues with the game.

[Section 3](LOGS.md) explains how to read `debug.log` and `crash-reports.`
