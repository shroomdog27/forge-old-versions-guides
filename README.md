# Forge Old Versions Self-Help Guide
## Prelude
Hello! This is a collection of self-help guides for old Minecraft versions. Everyone in the forge discord, including staff and other users, cannot provide support for old versions. Forge operates on the current version, plus 1 LTS version receiving support. These guides are intended to teach you how to help yourself with versions other than the supported ones. The purpose of these guides are to go over common issues with old versions, as well on how to read the `debug.log` and `crash-reports`. 

**DO NOT POST ANY LOGS TO #tech-support IN THE FORGE DISCORD. YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY HELP, IN ACCORDANCE WITH #rules 11. THESE GUIDES ARE THE ONLY HELP YOU WILL RECEIVE FROM THE FORGE DISCORD.**

With that out of the way, let's get started!

There are three guides currently available. 

[INSTALLERS](INSTALLERS.md) goes over common issues with the Forge Installers.

[ISSUES](ISSUES.md) goes over common issues with the game.

[LOGS](LOGS.md) explains how to read `debug.log` and `crash-reports.`
